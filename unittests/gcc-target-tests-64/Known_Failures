# Fails even on host device
# 'test_pextrw' does a zero extend to the gpr
# Which means its -3339 value turns in to 0xf2f5
# While the 'compute_correct_result' value does a sign extension
# Which turns the value in to 0xfffff2f5
# This causes its comparison to fail

# Test has invalid asm. Fails on host as well.
# It passes for -n 500 due to x87 stack optimization pass
# not actually doing a fld/fst pair and instead doing the 
# memory store directly.
